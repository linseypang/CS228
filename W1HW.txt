1) Prior odds matter in determining whether you actually have the disease.

P(Disease | Positive Test) = P(Positive Test | Disease) * P (Disease) / P (Positive Test)

= .99 * 1/10000 / (9999/10000 * .01 + 1/10000 *.99) = 0.00980392156

2) Since the system is markov, you only need to keep track of the last variable to determine the DP structure.

Let DP[k][d] be the max(x1..xk) P(x1..xk, ******) for xk = d. Thus, DP is a n*m array. The transition is DP[k][d] =  max over d DP[k-1][d] + P(xk,d)

n*m*m


3) 3 cycle graph, where each node guarantees that the next node is the opposite of what you currently are. If 0/1, then you get a contradiction upon cycle



4) 
  1. P(A|B,Y) = P(A,B,Y) / P(B,Y)
    P(A,B,Y) is unfindable because P(B,Y|A) can't be found without conditional independence
  2. Yes, direct application of Bayes Rule
  3. No, you can't ever figure out P(B,Y|A) because no independence


  PART 2.

  1. Yes, go through route 1 then find P(B,Y|A) through independence
  2. Yes (obviously on part 1)
  3. No, you can't find P(B,Y) ever because you can't seperate the given A away.


5)
  1a. A and B are independent (no common ancestors) .8*.3 = .24
  1b. A has no effect on E (neither descendent nor acestory ) .7*.1 + .3*.9 = .34 (just conditions on B 0/1)

  D-sep is independent, conditioned on
  2a) No, because the graph can be decomposed to be A -> H <-E, so conditioning on H opens up a path from A to E.

  2b) G and E are completely separate, and D gives no information at all on E.
  2c) No, you can still take E to get infromation from B to H.


6) 
  1. 0.5 LOL
  2. Admits must have between .5-1 on creativity and intelligence, otherwise, they wouldn't be able to make it up with the other stat.

  THINK 

  x-.5 = [0.5x^2-.5x][1,.5] = 0+.125 =  .625  
  MAYBE WANT TO CHECK THIS CALCULATION


  .5 + Integral .5-1, x-.5 = [0.5x^2-.5x][1,.5] = 0+.125 =  .625  

  MAYBE WANT TO CHECK THIS CALCULATION


  EV = Integral of P(x) * x
  P(student) = 1/8 (area of square)


  AHAHAHAHHA MATHI S HARD



  3) (.55+1)/2 = 0.775 independent

  4) 

  OK, given you are admitted and I = 0.95, then your creativity ranges from .55 to 1 uniformly. Thus, it is 1.55/2 = .725

  It should be lower than 2, because it locks at an instant, and this instant is higher.
  WAIT IM SO CONFUSED

7) Burgalary and EQ to John Call and MaryCall (4 connections)

Explicit:

If you want to remove node X.

A -> B -> C ====> A -> C

P(A,B,C) = P(A) * P(B|A) * P(C|B)


For each child C of node X:
  Calculate every possible input values from the parents of C:
  For each possible value V of this child C:
    

If P(B=b|A=a), then P(C=c|A=a) = SUM_allb(P(C=c|b)*P(B=b|a))


8a) You depend only on your parents and your children.



8b) Do the hint exactly P(A,B) = P(A)*P(B|A), so the sample is exactly what you want
Generate the parents first, then go down the chain (decompose the bayesian net)



PROGRAMMING:

1) 2^(28*28)
2) 2^(28*28)-1, since you need a probability for every single vector - 1 since it sums to one.
3) Z can take values from [-3, 3] stepping at .25 intervals -> [-12,12] at integer intervals = 25 different values. Thus, to specify each of Z1,Z2, you need (25-1)*2 = 48 parameters

To specify each of X1-X784, you need P(0|Z) for all Z since P(1|Z) is just 1 - P(0|Z). Thus, you need 25*784 = 19600. Thus the answer is 19648. FIX THIS
